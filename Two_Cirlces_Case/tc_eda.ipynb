    "IMPORTANT: This data is of TIMESERIES. Each partner and postid combination is the viewing of said partner in social media! The 'snapshot' date is the time in which the data of how a partner's sponsorship is captured overtime. Each entry is duplicated, only differing by the brandexposurevalue.\n",
    "- I am starting to think the 'partner_exposure_date' is when the partner showed the AD and the shapshot date is far in the future to see what has occured since then. Usually 3+ months later. Maybe to catch stragglers -> When summarizing, should use the last entry to get the more \"wholistic\" number. But can also show overtime impressions (cumulative).\n",
    "\n",
    "How can everything but the exposure_id and brand_exposure_value be the same for an entry? -> Remove these duplicated rows. For rows with the same post_id, exposure_id, and snapshot_time, take the one with the larger brand_exposure_value\n",
    "- Ok so for the fanduel case I found that they had different exposure_id but same post_id. Maybe the brands logo is duplicated near eachother in a sports broadcast. But if they we duplicated, why have the same Post_ID -> maybe its the same design and the exposure_id details the specific implementations. (i.e. class vs. instances of a class) Very common\n",
    "- Usually a unique pair of exposure_id + post_id will have 5 snapshots. two that are a day or less apart then three more that are spaced a week apart each. Likely to get more spread and such.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EDA Notes - Social Data\n",
    "Overall I am getting the sense that while some may be dedicated ADs, many are likely brand apperances in streaming services. I think this because of the 'asset' category detailing where a company may show up. ~~But I believe traditional ads are also included because Twitter + Text catgories of ads exist, and these are likely not excerpts from the game but from sports pages that CREATE these ads.~~ Games are streamed on muliple platforms. I am thinking partners showing up in social media can fall into three catagories: we own the page and it is part of a specific campaign, we own the page and we put out content (but not specific to a compaign or partner; incidental exposure), or we do not own the page + content is put out that may incidently contain the partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The 'contenttype' is the type of media (photo, video, text) shared by a page. -> Only twitter has the 'text' contenttype, and YT only appears under 'video' contenttype. The 'asset' is where the partners branding will appear in said media.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'snapshot_date' is likely the time that the ad was exposed to watchers. Range is fairly small.\n",
    "- 'partnerexposuredate' could be the date at which the partner saw the ad, gave it the greenlight, and allowed it to be used for marketing. All 'snapshot_date' entries occur AFTER their corresponding 'partnerexposuredate'\n",
    "- 'contenttype' has full coverage and can be video (FB, Twitter, YT), text (Twitter), or photo (FB, Twitter). \n",
    "- 'postid' likely refers to the specific piece of media that is being pushed (i.e. unique ad)\n",
    "- 'exposureid' is likely a UUID for the individual exposures of an ad to watchers\n",
    "- 'channel' is the social media platform where the ad was viewed\n",
    "- 'partner' is the company our client is partnered with for promotions\n",
    "- 'feed_name' has full coverage and is either 'Owned' or 'Earned' -> likely either promote on owned social media pages or promoted via other influencers that are paid\n",
    "- 'campaign' likely details if a post falls under a catageory of posts that are routine or focus on a specific event (i.e. Sunday Football, Play Highlights)\n",
    "- 'asset' is where the partners logo/ad appears on the screen (i.e. scoreboard, watermark, on-court signage). It occurs IN-GAME BROADCASTS; this is apparent since all the entries in the Broadcast Data have this entry.\n",
    "- 'impressions' are likely a count of all the people that viewed a speicif brand's ad; furthermore 'projectedimpressions' are likely the output from predictive model that only applied to SOME ads. Either 'projectedimpressions' is non-null or 'impressions' is non-null. Both cannot exist at the same time -> 'projectedimpressions' is likely a proxy for impressions when we cannot directly measure it. \n",
    "- 'video_views', 'impressions', and 'engagement' are all either null or present mostly (linked to above). Impressions >> Views, Engagement; social media platforms likely have a lower cutoff for what counts as an impression.\n",
    "    - video_views == logo_impressions when they both are not null\n",
    "- For 'video_views' to be not null, the 'contenttype' must be a video, however 'impressions' can be not null for a variety of types.\n",
    "- 'brand_exposure_value' is a lagging indicator that measures momentum between impressions overtime for consecutive snapshots. Just as impressions, views, and engagement is only increasing, so is this\n",
    "\n",
    "All entries with 'feed_name' = 'Earned' have non-null projectedimpressions. This may be because when we pay to promote a post, we may get back the estimated number of people it will reach. \\\n",
