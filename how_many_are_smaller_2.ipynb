    "    Let A0 be the left-most/smallest value of the Left array, and B0 be the same for the Right.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As we are merging the numbers we keep a count of how many elements in the Right array (starting with B0 and going onward) \n",
    "    are smaller than A0. Once we exhaust this, we add the count C to the result array for A0 and add it into the merge. \n",
    "    -> All values less than A0 in the right array have been counted\n",
    "\n",
    "    We then do NOT reset the count C. Because Left is in sorted order, A1 >= A0, and thus every term in Right that A0 is greater than, A1\n",
    "    will also be greater than. \n",

    "    We will then repeat the procedure above for A1, A2, A3, ... until be have exhausted all values in both arrays.\n",
